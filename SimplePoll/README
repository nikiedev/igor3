 # How to Use Simple Poll

 -- Simple Poll Admin Instructions

    1. Goto http://domain/to/dir/admin/index.php to setup your polls
    2. There you will be able to view, add, modify and delete polls

 -- Simple Poll can be used on your site using the following
    (example.php can get you started - includes everything needed)

    1. First, you will need the css/default.css, js/jquery-1.5.2.min.js,
       js/jquery.formerize-0.1.js, and js/simplepoll.js files included in the
       head of your html documents that use the below include file.
       
    2. PHP include statement. Change "pollid" to the poll you wish to display
       This code is also displayed for each poll in your admin area for you to
       copy and paste.

       a. <?php $pollid = 3; include("simplepoll.php"); ?>

    3. Layout / Style can be modified in css/default.css to make your polls
       look more like your website.
       
 # TROUBLE SHOOTING
